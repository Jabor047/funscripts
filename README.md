Various scripts I have written

# SCRIPTS
**1. Create Open Run**
-This script takes one or two arguments the first being the name of the file and the second being the directory where you want the file created. If you only enter one argument the file is created in current directory where the script is being run.
-Edit the variable **editor_path** to select your editor and **python_path** for the python path. (Where the editor and python are installed) 
-After the file is created your chosen text editor opens the file and you can edit it however you wish.
-After you close your editor. python runs the created script for you.

**2. Local shuffle**
-You know how you have watched all your favourite shows multiple times and have them in your hard drive and you don't have anything to watch.This script will play a random episode of your selected show.
-You just have to Change the variable **watchdir** in the script. Change the **player_path** variable to change to the media player you use.
-You will have to categorize your shows into subfolders for the best experience e.g All-Shows - Comedy - Arrested Development, All-shows - Drama - Scandal e.t.c

**Enjoy Mate!**
